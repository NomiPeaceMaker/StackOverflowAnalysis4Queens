        "You're interested in understanding the behaviour of contributors on https://stackoverflow.com/ (SO). For this analysis, you first need to:\n",

        "1. generate plots to understand the differences in distribution of the 5 metrics between the posts of the two tags\n",

        "You can use any programming language, library, etc. that you desire. You just need to use a private GitHub repository to develop your code, tests, a README file explaining any design choices (e.g., the 5 metrics) and assumptions, the analyses used, as well as discussing the results of your analyses. Please also add the obtained csv files. Finally, don't forget to clearly comment the code and provide access to your GitHub repository to user \"bramadams\"."
